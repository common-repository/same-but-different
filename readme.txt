== Description ==

*Display related posts based on common categories and tags.*

Same but Different is a WordPress plugin that adds a list of related posts at the bottom of your blog posts. The related posts are intuitively linked by pulling in any posts that are in the same categories or have the same tags as the post that is currently being viewed. This saves you from the tedious task of manually relating posts.

#### Related Posts Widget

Same but Different also gives you access to a related posts widget. Simply drag and drop the Same but Different widget into your sidebar, enter the number of posts to display and select if they should be linked by categories, tags or both. The widget also allows you to choose whether the related posts should be ordered by date descending or ascending.
